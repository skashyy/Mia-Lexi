    <h4> MiaLexi means one word in Greek. </h4>
    <br>
    <h4> MiaLexi was built with the help from Reece Buckner-Wolfson, Eunseo Choo, Will Haskey, Tarun Sepuri, Sasha Wallace, and Hunter Welch </h4>
    <br>
    <h4> The purpose of MiaLexi is to allow readers to be able to read faster. With MiaLexi, users are able to enhance their reading speed by displaying one word at a time, allowing the user to not only enhance their focusing abilities when reading, but also prevents them from getting lost in the page </h4>
    <br>
    <h4> One feature that helps us stand out is our Censorship feature. In order to accomodate our program for educational purposes as well as for children, we have implemented a feature that allows user to add words to censor</h4>
    <br>
    <h4> Our authentication feature allows users to log in and keep track of the readings and/or the words that they have censored from the reading. </h4>
    <br>
    <h4> Our main goal with MiaLexi is to allow the user to improve their reading speed while making it accessible for users and different educational industries</h4>
